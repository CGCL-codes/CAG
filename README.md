# CAG
CAG is an efficient stream processing system that efficiently maintains load balance and efficiently provides a solution to consistent partitioning and minimizes aggregation cost. CAG limits the partition of data and processes the DAG in one node. We reduce the partition of data, so that stream processing's overall computation and aggregation cost remain low. The results of the experiment using large-scale real-world datasets show that CAG achieves a 3.5Ã— improvement in terms of processing throughput and reduces the latency by 97% compared to state-of-the-art design.

# Introduction
Currnt distributed stream processing systems like Storm, Flink, Samze, S4, etc. primary objective is to process data with high throughput at low latency. 

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.

```bash
pip install foobar
```

## Usage

```python
import foobar

foobar.pluralize('word') # returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('goose') # returns 'geese'
foobar.singularize('phenomena') # returns 'phenomenon'
```
